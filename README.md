**Monetisation layer for AI economy**

We're building the future of AI application billing—where users pay for what they use, and developers don't get stuck with the infrastructure bill.

---

## The Problem

AI applications are expensive to run. Really expensive.

Current models force developers to either:
- **Absorb crushing infrastructure costs** that scale unpredictably with user adoption
- **Lock users into rigid subscription tiers** that don't reflect actual usage
- **Build complex billing systems** from scratch instead of focusing on their core product

Meanwhile, users are frustrated with:
- Paying for features they don't use
- Being locked into platforms with their credits
- Lack of transparency in AI usage costs

## Our Solution

**Åndra is a usage-based billing platform purpose-built for the new generation of AI-powered applications.**

We enable developers to transfer AI infrastructure costs directly to end users through transparent, portable pay-per-use pricing. Think of us as the billing and identity layer that makes AI applications financially sustainable while giving users complete control.

### 🎯 **Key Benefits**

**For Developers:**
- **Shift infrastructure costs** to end users seamlessly
- **Plug-and-play integration** with existing AI applications
- **Focus on building** instead of billing infrastructure
- **Scale confidently** without worrying about LLM bills

**For End Users:**
- **Pay only for what you use** with transparent pricing
- **Portable AI credits** that work across different applications
- **Complete transparency** into your AI usage and costs
- **Control your spending** with real-time usage tracking

## How It Works

1. **Integrate Åndra** into your AI application with our simple SDK
2. **Users top up** their Åndra account with AI credits
3. **Usage is tracked** automatically as they use your application
4. **Costs are deducted** transparently from their credit balance
5. **Users can take their credits** to any other Åndra-enabled application

Simple. Transparent. Fair.
